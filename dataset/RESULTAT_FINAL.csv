Chowder was called upon to examine young Angelica Neal who had suffered from a vampire attack. Chowder immediately recognized the symptoms and informed her father Frank that his daughter was the victim of a vampire. He performed a blood transfusion between Angelica and her mother Laurie. Rather than administering conventional medical care, Doctor Chowder provided Frank Neal with a string of garlic cloves (which he just happened to have been carrying on his person). He advised Neal to hang them from his daughter's window. That evening, Dracula attacked again, but this time his victim was Laurie Neal. The viciousness of the attack, in combination with the blood she already loss due to the transfusion, resulted in Laurie's immediate death. Doctor Chowder attended the funeral service officiated by bishop Father McFarland and later accompanied McFarland and Frank Neal on an attack against Dracula. Though McFarland was killed, Doctor Chowder assisted Frank Neal in operating a lighthouse beacon which drove the vampire away. Doctor Chowder's activities following this incident are unknown, though it is safe to assume that he likely passed away of natural causes in the intervening years.[285]

He was a normal human, honest and faithful to the throne and probably a sage. He was considered trustworthy by Taramis, and the people listened his words. After Salome took Taramis identity, Krallides understood that something went wrong, and, after many months of odd behavior of the false Taramis, he started to believe that Taramis wasn't the real one but a false. Krallides tried to convince the Khauran population that the Queen was not Taramis but Salome had him captured and beheaded. Then Salome used Krallides' head to torture Taramis. Khumbanigash gave the head to Marcios, who was disguised as a deaf-mute and who learned that both Conan and Krallides were right and started his plans for the liberation of the Queen.[104]
